# Catherine Modules

This repository contains all of the external Catherine modules available for download via the Catherine framework.

The modules can be downloaded directly within the Catherine shell. If you would like to build them yourself, you can run the following commands, which will set everything up for Catherine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hifumitech/catherine-modules && mkdir ~/.catherine
```

```bash
mv catherine-modules ~/.catherine/
cd ~/.catherine/catherine-modules
```

```bash
chmod + build.sh
./build.sh
```

Most of these modules can also be ran as a CLI, so feel free to run `-h` or `--help` on most of them with the appropriate compiler or interpreter to learn more about their functionality.

More information is available within the individual categories (directories) for each module.
